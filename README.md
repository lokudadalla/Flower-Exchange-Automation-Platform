  <p>
        <strong>Flower Exchange Automation Platform</strong> is a project designed to automate the buying and selling of flowers in a digital marketplace. 
        This platform allows users to place orders for various flower types, track the status of orders, and manage an inventory of floral products. 
        The system provides a seamless interface for placing and managing orders with real-time updates.
    </p>
    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <p>
        The main idea of the <strong>Flower Exchange Automation Platform</strong> is to create a digital system where florists, customers, and vendors can exchange floral products efficiently. 
        The system simplifies the management of orders, allowing users to submit orders, fetch the list of available orders, and view the status of their orders, all in one platform.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Submit and manage flower orders digitally.</li>
        <li>Real-time updates on order submissions and status tracking.</li>
        <li>Supports multiple flower types (e.g., Rose, Lavender, Lotus, etc.).</li>
        <li>User-friendly interface with a modern design for seamless interaction.</li>
        <li>Data stored and managed in CSV format for easy accessibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Technical Stack</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: Built using React.js with Material-UI for responsive and interactive UI components.</li>
        <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Node.js with Express to handle server-side logic and API endpoints.</li>
        <li><strong>CSV Management</strong>: CSV parsing and manipulation for order data storage.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>
        Users can place flower orders through a web interface where they enter the required details such as the flower type, quantity, and price. 
        These orders are validated and submitted to the backend, where they are saved in a CSV file for record-keeping.
        Users can also view their previously placed orders or fetch available orders through the system's API.
